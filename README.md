## random-password-generator
- This Python script is a simple password generator that creates randomized strings using letters, numbers, and symbols.
- It imports the `random` and `string` modules to build a character pool, then defines the `generate_password_random()` function with an optional length (default 12).
- The function randomly selects characters from the pool and joins them into a string, ensuring a unique password each time.
- The script finally runs the function with length 16 and prints the result.
